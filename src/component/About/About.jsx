            The participants of The 3rd Day Resurrection Global Prayer Portal
            are those who are in hot pursuit of everything that God is and
            everything that God has. We believe that things that are locked up
            in the realm of impossibility are eventually released when
            persistent faith is mixed with prayer and fasting (Mathew 17:21) We
            are a people who are persuaded that what’s impossible for man, only
            takes a nod from God. It is with this understanding that on the 3rd
            day of each month we have decided to position ourselves under the
            open heaven portal of His presence. Jesus said, “My house shall be a
            house of prayer for all nations” (Mark 11:17) Every 3rd day of the
            month @ 3pm you are welcomed to come and agree with us in corporate
            unity.
